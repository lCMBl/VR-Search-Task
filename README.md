# VR Search Task

This program is a visual search task executed in a realistic VR environment, for the purpose of collecting eye, head, and EEG data. WIP.

The task the participants are given is to shoot the enemy targets while avoiding harm to their allies (distractors). These distractors are either easy or hard, depending on camo pattern similarity.

*All of the 3d assets were giving git a headache, so just the code has been uploaded for now.*
